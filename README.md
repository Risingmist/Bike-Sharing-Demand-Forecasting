# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Forecasting
This repository contains code and resources for predicting bike-sharing demand in a city using machine learning models. The goal is to forecast the total count of bikes rented in a given hour based on various environmental and seasonal factors. 
Data
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle's Bike Sharing Demand competition. It includes features such as weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and time-related information.
