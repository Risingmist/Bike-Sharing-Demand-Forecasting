# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Forecasting
This repository contains code and resources for predicting bike-sharing demand in a city using machine learning models. The goal is to forecast the total count of bikes rented in a given hour based on various environmental and seasonal factors. 

Data
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle's Bike Sharing Demand competition. It includes features such as weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and time-related information.

Contents
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks detailing data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
Data: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
Scripts: Utility scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Models: Saved trained models or model weights.
Documentation: Additional resources, references, or project documentation.

Steps followed to build the model:-

### 1. Data Preprocessing:
- **Data Cleaning:** Check for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extract useful features from the provided data (e.g., extracting date features from datetime).
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Convert categorical variables like 'season', 'holiday', 'weather' into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- **Visualize Relationships:** Explore correlations between variables using graphs and statistical methods.
- **Understand Distributions:** Check the distribution of the target variable ('count') and other variables.
- **Identify Patterns:** Look for patterns or trends in rental counts concerning different factors (e.g., weather, time of day, etc.).

### 3. Feature Selection:
- **Correlation Analysis:** Identify highly correlated features and eliminate redundant ones.
- **Feature Importance:** Use techniques like RandomForest or Gradient Boosting to determine which features are most influential.

### 4. Model Selection and Training:
- Choose appropriate regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train the chosen models on the training data.

### 5. Model Evaluation:
- Use evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess model performance.
- Evaluate the model on the testing set to ensure it generalizes well.

### 6. Model Tuning and Improvement:
- Tune hyperparameters to improve model performance using techniques like cross-validation or grid search.
- Consider ensemble methods or more sophisticated algorithms to enhance predictions.

### 7. Model Deployment and Monitoring:
- Deploy the model into a production environment where it can make predictions based on new inputs.
- Continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain/update it as needed with new data.
